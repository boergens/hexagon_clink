# DD Allocation Brief Field

## Option 1 (Emphasizes INCITE prep)

We seek to resolve an open problem in discrete geometry: determining the minimum number of hexagonal lattice arrangements required for complete pair coverage at n=17 elements. Our current SAT-based approach requires evaluating ~26 million candidate configurations, infeasible on local resources. This DD allocation will enable us to (1) complete the n=17 search, (2) optimize our solver for leadership-scale parallelism, and (3) prepare a competitive INCITE proposal targeting the full sequence bounds for n≤30. Results will be submitted to a combinatorics journal (e.g., Journal of Combinatorial Theory) and presented at a relevant conference.

## Option 2 (Shorter, more direct)

Purpose: Resolve minimum covering number for unit disk contact graphs at n=17 vertices—an open combinatorial problem requiring evaluation of ~26M configurations via SAT solving. Outcome: (1) Definitive answer for n=17, (2) optimized parallel solver ready for INCITE-scale runs on larger n, (3) publication in combinatorics/discrete math journal. This DD award will validate our approach and prepare us for a full INCITE proposal targeting the complete sequence bounds.

## Option 3 (Minimal)

Determine minimum arrangement bounds for hexagonal lattice contact graphs at n=17 (open problem). Requires ~26M SAT evaluations. DD allocation enables: completion of n=17 search, solver optimization for leadership platforms, preparation of INCITE proposal for n≤30 sequence. Publication planned for combinatorics journal.
